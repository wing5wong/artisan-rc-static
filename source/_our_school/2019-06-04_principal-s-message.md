Welcome to Ruapehu College. We are dedicated to empowering our students by gifting them the tools they need to succeed in life. Being a close-knit college of 260 students allows us to truly know every learner. With small class sizes and a mentor who stays with them from Year 9 to 13, no student gets lost in the crowd.



Our kaiako are not just educators; they are passionate mentors committed to giving their best every day. We tailor learning to fit the student—not the other way around. By focusing on individual interests and offering pathways ranging from trades and industry courses to university scholarships, we help our students achieve their goals.



At the heart of our school is the belief that ‘each one counts.’ Every student, every lesson, and every day matters. This culture of care is grounded in our history; we have taught successive generations of local whānau, creating a strong bond where alumni and community members always feel at home. Students leave here with a sense of belonging that lasts a lifetime, ready to seek knowledge: Rapuhia Kote Mātauranga.

Principal, Mr Kris Vine
