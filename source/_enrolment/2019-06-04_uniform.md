We appreciate the expense and effort that parents and caregivers make in order to have students meet the collegeâ€™s uniform standards. To assist us in maintaining this high standard, please go through the uniform requirements below carefully with your child to check that what they are wearing as uniform at is acceptable. Remember, skirts must be knee length, so please help us to enforce this. If you are in any doubt about issues to do with uniform, please contact the deans, at the College.
