I hope you are all well in your family bubbles.

The Prime Minister has confirmed that schools will be open from 29 April for year 9 and 10

students only with restrictions. Year 11, 12, and 13 are to continue with distance learning at home.

Under Level 3 the Prime Minister has also made it clear that the overriding principle is for students

to stay at home and to continue distance learning. However, if you deem it necessary to send your

children to school then children must be free from any signs of illness.

Over the next few days, office staff will be contacting our entire year 9 and year 10 parent and

caregiver community to determine if you will be sending your children to school. This information

needs to be accurate to aid our preparations for student returns. It is important that you know that

the onsite learning at school will be the same as the online and distance learning at home, and that

we will be doing our utmost to protect students and the bubbles to which they belong.

We are also acutely aware of the critical importance of getting this right, as our school community

is quite unique in that it comprises a number of caregivers who are grandparents. They comprise

an at-risk group and we are determined to protect them at all costs, as an illness, or heaven forbid

a loss, would be devastating to us all.

The college’s safety protocols are as follows:

CLEANING

\- The college will be commercially cleaned this week.

\- Hand sanitizer and paper towels will be available in every classroom.

\- Bathrooms will be checked and restocked twice daily \[hand sanitiser/paper towels].

STUDENT BUBBLES

\- Students will be assigned to their own bubble of 10.

\- Each student bubble will be assigned to their own homeroom \[classroom].

\- Students will remain in the same homeroom for the entire school day.

\- There will be no practical lessons \[food technology, soft materials, hard materials, PE].

\- Each student will be assigned to their own desk and chair in their homeroom.

\- Learning resources will not be shared.

\- Homeroom surfaces will be sanitised twice daily.

\- Each bubble will be allocated times for non-contact exercise outside \[weather permitting].

STUDENT BREAKS

\- There will be no interaction between student bubbles.

\- Students will be supervised in their bubbles during breaks.

\- Each bubble will have their own area of the school with which they will have their breaks.

\- Each bubble will be allocated times to access the canteen.

GENERAL

\- PPE \[disposable masks only] will be available on request \[until stocks run out].

\- Physical distancing will be enforced \[1m inside and 2m outside].

\- Homerooms will remain unlocked to avoid students waiting in lines at the start of the day

and after each break.

\- Each year level will be assigned to their own bathroom.

\- Only one student in the bathroom at a time.

\- Student movement within the school from bus drop off to bus pick up will be supervised by

staff, in single file, keeping to the left hand side of corridors when inside.

FIRST DAY BACK - ASSEMBLY

\- Students will be met at the bus stop and walked single file to the hall.

\- If students are dropped off, they are to go directly to the hall.

\- Hall seating will be in single chairs in rows and columns, spaced 2m apart.

\- Students will be welcomed back and informed of the protocols of returning to school under

Level 3, the importance of not compromising the safety protocols, and encouraged to focus

their energies upon their learning.

\- Our entire student body, both juniors and seniors will be recognised for their strength of

character that they have shown to learn under these conditions.

\- Students who are present will be informed how to seek support and help if they are feelingoverwhelmed, anxious or under any stress.

\- Student well-being remains paramount to us.

\- Students will be invited to ask any questions that they may have.

\- Students will then be informed of their respective year group bubble of 10, and their

homeroom teacher.

\- Once each bubble of 10 has been named, they will then be escorted in a single file from the

hall to their homeroom to start their onsite learning.

SCHOOL BUSES

\- Will be operating with physical distance rules enforced, however, parents and caregivers

may prefer to transport their children instead.

We are all in this together, and I would like to echo the Prime Minister’s call to “Be kind”. I am both

humbled and proud to be leading the school during this time with you, continuing to serve our

wonderful community together, and building upon the successes that our teachers, Board, and

leadership team have set before us. If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the school office from the 28 April.

Naku noa,

Marama Allen

Acting Principal
