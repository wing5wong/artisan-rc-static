At Ruapehu College we aim to empower young people through education by gifting them the skills and values to succeed in an ever changing world.

As a boutique college of 250 students, we offer small class-sizes taught by a team of subject-specialist educators, and a designated academic mentor that journeys alongside their students from year 9 to 13. Students’ learning programs are tailored to meet the National Education Learning Priorities with differentiated teaching to support interests and strengths, and an opportunity to pursue career pathways through industry courses, gateway industry-placements, scholarship examinations, and tertiary study. This is one of the reasons why our students consistently do well in achieving NCEA.

Our teachers are passionate, and committed to give each learner their very best, building relationships grounded upon respect. Teachers are led by a dedicated pedagogical team that focuses continually on improving teacher practice of teaching and learning through ongoing professional development, and real-life observations where it matters most, in the classroom. We invest in this heavily because this is our core business. In the pursuit of excellence, 'each one counts'. This means each person, each day, each lesson, each action, and each and every opportunity - they all matter.

The culture of the college is founded upon a rich heritage of respect and care. The college has taught many whānau across successive generations, alumni return, and all contribute to the call whenever the college has a need. This is done freely because all who come to this college know that their place is just as important as it's always been. Students gain this same sense of belonging that becomes lifelong, just as their learning is - Rapuhia Kote Mātauranga.

Principal, Marama Allen
