Kia ora koutou katoa,

I hope you and your family are well and that we can keep our community safe. 

Our focus as always will be to support the learning, safety and the wellbeing of our students. With the short notice moving into lockdown, we weren’t able to hand out devices or hard materials to students in order to support distance learning.

Therefore the following is our Distance Learning Plan for the next three days. 

Deputy Principals Mr Mackrell and Mr Darmody, are overseeing curriculum subjects in the following areas:

Mr Mackrell	Aghort, Biology, Chemistry, English, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Science, Social Studies, Te Reo, Tourism and Work Ready. 

Mr Darmody	Art and Photography, Design Visual Communication, Digital Technology, Foods, PE and Health, Performing Arts, Resistant Materials, Textiles

Students should hear from their teachers through Google Classroom or emails.

For any subject related queries, please contact the teacher or the relevant deputy principal. Emails can be found on the school website under staff. 

For video conferencing subjects, the contact person is Mrs Kendal Richards distancelaerning@ruapehu.school.nz

If students do not have access to a device, it is recommended to spend some time reading, going over subject notes, sketching, practising subject skills and getting some physical exercise. 

Finally, please take care over the next few days. 

 Kia noho haumaru. Keep well, keep safe.
