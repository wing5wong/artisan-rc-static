Ruapehu College is pleased to announce that for 2026 we will be offering a free and healthy lunch on each school day for every student enrolled. The food provided will meet the Ministry of Health Food Guidelines and the Food Act 2014. The college will also actively work towards a zero-waste policy with a waste management plan that aims to reduce, reuse and recycle.

As part of the food requirements, food allergens and restrictions due to religious reasons will be catered for, but food preferences will not be. 

**School Lunch Team**

Our wonderful school lunch team, Bubba Wall and Talia Ruki who are making our student lunches. The students say they were really yummy.
