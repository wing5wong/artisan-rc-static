2021 Competition Cancelled

After discussions with School Sport NZ and Ruapehu Alpine Lifts Ltd representatives today, it has been decided to cancel the 2021 North Island Primary & Secondary Schools Snowboard Championships.

It is probably not surprising news with our current number of Covid cases and Auckland still being at Level 4.

It is good to have a decision made now, a month before the event was scheduled to occur and hopefully all the Schools will be able to get refunds for their accomodation.

I am looking forward to next year and the comp going ahead on Monday - Wednesday, 26-28 September 2022 at Turoa Ski Field, Mt Ruapehu.

Thank you for your support.
