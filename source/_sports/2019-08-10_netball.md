Netball training got underway. The coach for Netball is Lydene Hayes who is a very experienced coach, player and referee. Some scheduled games from other schools netball have been cancelled at this stage but may be rescheduled towards the end of the year. This is due to level 2 lock down restrictions. We are happy to be at school and that sport training is going ahead
