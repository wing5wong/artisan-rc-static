School sport changes

Changes to school sport come into force through the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Order from 11.59pm Saturday 12 March 2022. 

All children and young people, regardless of their vaccination status, can participate in school-organised teams and groups, or as an individual representing the school in a competition or event. This applies whether on or off the school site, and to registered schools only. 



School organised teams, groups and individuals are to be treated as if they are vaccinated and cannot be required to show a My Vaccine Pass. This means the capacity limits for vaccinated students are applied when sport takes place out of school hours, or off school grounds.  



Supporting staff, including coaches, managers, teachers and parent volunteers continue to be required to be vaccinated. This includes student coaches both when they coach teams from their own school, and those from other schools. They will still be required to show a My Vaccine Pass if the external venue or facility requires. 



If you have further questions, Sport NZ has updated their School Sport guidance on their website.

Please refer to our FAQs in the first instance or if you have further queries then contact us at covid19response@sportnz.org.nz.
