The Smokefree Rockquest has become the lynchpin of events for secondary school musicians over the last 30 years. Ruapehu College has entered this event consistently since 2017 and enjoyed some great success sharing their songwriting and performing passions in competition against other secondary schools in the Whanganui region. So far, one act has made the eye of the National Finals panel.

Musicians may enter as a solo act, duo, or band. Each act is required to compose and perform original compositions in the regional shows in an attempt to gain the opportunity to record a live video of material to be considered for the National Final. Many a-Rockquest competitor has gone on to forge a career in the music industry including Anika Moa, Bic Runga, Nesian Mystik, Evermore, Broods, and Alien Weaponry.

Thousands of students from across Aotearoa enter every year and the Whanganui region is growing rapidly. Our students work very hard to get to Rockquest, with many rehearsals and sessions outside of school hours. This commitment is what enables our students to succeed on this stage, in this event. Commitment, focus and dedication.

NCEA students that enter the Smokefree Rockquest can be assessed for Group Performance, Solo Performance, Composition, and Song-writing Standards at each level.

**2021** The Smokefree Rockquest saw the highest ever number of Ruapehu College students (22) signing up as the mana of competing in the competition continues to grow. The entire Year 11 class made up the band “Violent Attraction”, there were six Year 12 and 13 students in “Hiraeth”, and seven in “Out Of Order” from Year 10, including ex-student Ben Burton from Fielding High School on vocals. In the Solo/Duo category, Year 9 Isla Thompson and Year 10 Tarn Hoyle formed the duo “Below Zero”. All of the students put in an exceptional amount of work into the Rockquest journey both in and out of school. Writing, jamming, rehearsing and refining their original music became an immensely satisfying process for all. With a performance practice to the school under their belts, the groups hit the stage at the Whanganui Royal Opera House and were very well received. The environment at the Rockquest show is always wonderful. It is a crucial part of our young songwriters and musicians feeling validated in what they do as the support and enthusiasm from the other competitors from other schools shows pursuits. The performances on the night were excellent and “Hiraeth” walked away with the “ZM People’s Choice” award. This was the second time receiving this honour for Year 13s Jenna Jones and Korbyn Garland, who had won this award with their band “Altitude” in 2019. In it’s 32nd year, the Smokefree Rockquest continues to provide the major national songwriting and performance  platform. It is a significant part of the Senior NCEA curriculum within a real-life context, project-based learning environment. It breeds excellence and I am proud of our students’ track-record at the event.
