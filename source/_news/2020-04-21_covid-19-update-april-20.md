**School will remain closed until we move to alert level 3 on Wednesday 1 September.**

**EDUCATION at ALERT LEVEL 3**

1. COVID-19 UPDATE – 29 AUGUST 2021
   
    
   
   Kia ora parents and carers
   
    
   
   The Government has announced that we are safe to move to Alert Level 3 on Wednesday 1st September.
   
    
   
   At Alert Level 3, you legally must stay within your household bubble unless for essential personal movement including going to work and going to school. As the Prime Minister noted on Friday, schools are essentially closed at Alert Level 3 with the exception of those few children whose parents and carers must go to work at Alert Level 3, and there is no appropriate caregiver at home. Year 11 – 13 students are legally required to stay learning from home.
   
    
   
   Therefore, if you need to send your child to school, please let us know before Tuesday 10 am via one of the options below:
   
   Email               office@ruapehu.school.nz
   
   Text                 0220450441
   
   Facebook        Ruapehu College \[private message]
   
    
   
   As you imagine it will not be school as we know it under Alert Level 2 or 1.  All children will continue with the distance learning programme, whether they are at home or on-site at school.
   
    
   
   All our usual safety precautions for Alert Level 3 will be in place which includes following all the recommendations from the public health experts. This means we will regularly clean and disinfect high touch surfaces, encourage everyone to frequently wash their hands and cover their coughs and sneezes, and keep everyone physically distanced from others as much as possible (1 metre inside and two metres outside). We will also keep school bubbles to no more than 10 students.
   
    
   
   Our contact tracing systems will be in place, which includes our attendance register and visitor register, and we will be limiting staff onsite with the majority of our team working from home.
   
    
   
   You can also assist everyone’s safety by keeping your child at home if they are feeling unwell.  
   
    
   
   It was pleasing to hear that across New Zealand compliance is high. As you have been doing, please continue to follow all the alert level requirements and stay at home. It is the best tool we have to keep our community safe.

Kia ora koutou katoa,

I hope you and your family are well and that we can keep our community safe. 

Our focus as always will be to support the learning, safety and the wellbeing of our students. With the short notice moving into lockdown, we weren’t able to hand out devices or hard materials to students in order to support distance learning.

Therefore the following is our Distance Learning Plan for the next three days. 

Deputy Principals Mr Mackrell and Mr Darmody, are overseeing curriculum subjects in the following areas:

Mr Mackrell	Aghort, Biology, Chemistry, English, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Science, Social Studies, Te Reo, Tourism and Work Ready. 

Mr Darmody	Art and Photography, Design Visual Communication, Digital Technology, Foods, PE and Health, Performing Arts, Resistant Materials, Textiles

Students should hear from their teachers through Google Classroom or emails.

For any subject related queries, please contact the teacher or the relevant deputy principal. Emails can be found on the school website under staff. 

For video conferencing subjects, the contact person is Mrs Kendal Richards distancelaerning@ruapehu.school.nz

If students do not have access to a device, it is recommended to spend some time reading, going over subject notes, sketching, practising subject skills and getting some physical exercise. 

Finally, please take care over the next few days. 

 Kia noho haumaru. Keep well, keep safe.
