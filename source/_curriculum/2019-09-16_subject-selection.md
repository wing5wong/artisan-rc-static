SUBJECT SELECTION 

During these last two weeks of term 3, students will be selecting their subjects for the next year.

\- discussion on curriculum pathways in mentoring time

\- personalised letters via email to all students from Year 10  to Year 12 regarding how to access subject selection via the kamar portal page.

\- a curriculum information booklet provided to parents and students via email, the school website or available upon request at the front office

\- academic mentoring scheduled to discuss subject selection with students. Parents are welcome to attend. Arrangements can be made by contacting the front office.

   Year 12 as required.

   Year 11 –September 

   Year 10 – September.

 Any further queries regarding subject selection, please do not hesitate to contact Marama Allen at the college.
