As we close the chapter on another incredible year of Waka Ama at Ruapehu College, we celebrate the exceptional tauira who paddled their hearts out in 2025. With courage, commitment, and unity, these students have shown what it truly means to be part of something greater than themselves.

From the very first training session to the final race at Nationals, our paddlers embodied the values of teamwork, resilience, and leadership. In just a short season, they achieved extraordinary milestones - forging lifelong friendships and proudly representing our kura, their whānau, and iwi on the Whanganui awa and Lake Tikitapu ki Rotorua.

Week after week, these tauira committed to intense after-school fitness sessions and weekend water training. No matter the weather, they turned up with grit and determination. Early mornings, sore muscles, and tough drills were met with laughter, focus, and a shared drive to improve with every stroke.

Waka ama is not just a sport - it’s a way of life. Our teams learned to move as one, to trust deeply, and to lead with heart. Whether sprinting across the water or enduring long-distance paddles, every effort was powered by collective strength and mutual respect.
Despite the limited time we have, our teams made a powerful impact at the National Secondary School Waka Ama Championships. Podium finishes, reaching semis and finals, were just the beginning. The real victories were the personal triumphs - confidence gained, goals achieved, and memories made.
