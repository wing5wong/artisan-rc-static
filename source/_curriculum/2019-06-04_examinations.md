SENIOR EXAMINATIONS:

Next week (4/09 - 8/9) NCEA external examinations and senior benchmark examinations are taking place. 

The NCEA external examinations ( Science, Mathematics and Te Ao Haka ) cannot be re-sat if students are absent.

The other “benchmark” examinations provide the evidence for student derived grades. This is the mark a student will receive if they are absent from their end of year examinations for a genuine reason such as a bereavement or sickness supported by a sick note.
