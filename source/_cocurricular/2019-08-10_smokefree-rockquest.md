In 2020 Rockquest Promotions did exceptionally well to ensure that a competition took place. In it’s 31st year, not even Covid-19 could spoil the party although it did prevent any live staging of events, thus creating jeopardy around the viability of the traditional format of performance-based judging in front of a live audience. This meant that students had to capture the essence of their songwriting and performance on camera. We had more participants than ever before this year; entering Rockquest has become a badge of honour for our musicians at Ruapehu College and we hope it continues to be so. There was a wide range of entries across all categories with “Flower Of Hades” really taking it to the competition.

Solo Entries

Arnav Ram entered his percussion piece as solo act “ASSENTIA”. The judges praised the originality and complex rhythms of his piece “The Essence Of Hot Shower”. Korbyn Garland entered her NCEA composition “Don’t Wait”, this year stepping out on her own from last years success with her band “Altitude”. 

Duo Entries

Kate Rowe and Nazomi Groot composed a new song “Closer” to add to previous material they had each written in entering their fourth successive Rockquests. Both participating in the Solo category in 2019 and in the band ‘etc,etc…’ in Year 10 and 11. Their songwriting and performance was noted by the judges and although they did not place at the regional stage, they received a ‘Second Chance’ opportunity at the request and discretion of Rockquest Promotions Ltd. The duo took this opportunity and submitted further original pieces for consideration.

Sapphire Mapp and Davron Takitimu teamed up as “Maui Wowee” and placed 2nd in the category for the Whanganui region. Their laid-back, jazz infused tunes were a point of difference which made them stand out. The combination of clever lyrics and complex chord structures (“Blue Dream”) made for a particularly bold statement as teenaged musicians. They also submitted further work for national consideration.

Band Entry

‘Flower Of Hades’ - Top 25 Bands Finalist

Formed in the mind of Ryan Burton, this band played metal and they played hard! Amazing drumming with heavy riffs and just enough melody, Ryan wrote the lyrics and music for all of the songs over an 18-month period then recruited his bandmates. Younger brother Ben Burton(Year 9) as vocalist, Megan Rollerson on bass and Mackenzie Charlton on guitar. In his first year at Ruapehu College, Davron Takitimu completed the band, also playing guitar. The band worked hard to learn the material and rehearsed feverishly with incredible determination. They played well together, with Ryan driving the project towards the goal of making the National Final.

The band placed 2nd in the Whanganui Regional Final with their raw power and energetic performance getting the judges attention. At the second stage, with live performances still not possible, ‘Flower Of Hades’ submitted two further songs and put an even stronger case forward, working extremely hard to achieve a high quality sound to match their performance presence and metal attitudes.

Proudly, ‘Flower Of Hades’ made the final elimination list of 25 bands to be considered for a televised live final. From a pool of thousands, this is a truly remarkable achievement and one that each of the students truly deserved. They have set a very high standard for future students to aspire to, meet and improve on. We at Ruapehu College are incredibly proud of them and each of the entrants.
