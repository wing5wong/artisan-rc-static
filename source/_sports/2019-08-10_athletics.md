Athletics and ‘School Spirit’ Day

 Athletics day started out really cold with ‘nearly a frost’, but many of the students came in warm house colours clothes. The students were competing in their ages for the field events. There were points for participation and points for the students who were placed in their activities which included High jump, long jump, discus, shot put, triple jump and javelin.

 When the field events were finished, it was time for the track events. This year Mr Hart who organised the event, gave some time for house chants and the teams really got into the spirit of this. The chants were judged by parents and x students on the day.

 The races were fiercely contested and there were some very fast runs. The day ended with the whanau relays and the famous ‘student verse staff’ relay with the students winning by the smallest margin.

Congratulations to all out participants, winners and the staff who organised the day. Students will be selected for the Secondary Schools Athletics Competition to be held in Whanganui on the 13th March.
