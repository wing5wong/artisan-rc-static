Re: Ruapehu College School Ball

Senior students and staff are looking forward to the school ball on Saturday the 29th of July. 

\- Students are expected to arrive between 7.00 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. 

\- Formal dinner is expected to start by 7.45 p.m. 

\- The ball will finish at 11.00 p.m. 



The ball is a special college event with a wonderful tradition and is an important aspect of the college culture. The ball is an opportunity for students and staff to dress up, enjoy a meal together, dance and have a thoroughly enjoyable evening. It is well supported by staff, who without their input, the college ball would not happen. 



Students and guests are responsible for their transport to and from the venue. The college is responsible for the students while at the ball, whereas, before and after the ball is the parents’ responsibility. If students leave the venue, there is no re-entry and any student or guest who cannot meet the required standard of behaviour during this formal event will be sent home.



The college does not endorse or support any pre-ball or after-ball functions. The potential problems that can occur are detrimental to student safety and wellbeing, these are well documented in the media. 

For further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

Kind regards.

Marama Allen

Principal
