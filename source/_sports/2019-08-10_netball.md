Te Moana Hagley has made the U15 Te Pihinga netball team for the Aotea Maori netball nationals and Haeley Perkins-Tamatea has made the U17 Te Maahuru team.

The trainings for these girls is in Hawera every week so this a huge commitment for them and their families.

They are training for the 'Aotearoa Maori Netball Oranga Healthy Lifestyles' AMNHOL nationals held each year over Easter.
