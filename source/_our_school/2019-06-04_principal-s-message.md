Kia Ora Koutou.

Ruapehu College is set at the foot of the beautiful Mt Ruapehu and the location defines who we are. Our students continue to seek knowledge so they can head into the future with skills that will ensure success.

Our focus is academic and teachers foster independence so that students can enter University with the skills needed for tertiary education. We exploit the natural environment through our outdoor education programme which includes skiing and snowboarding as well as many other outdoor pursuits. Our students enjoy the many sports offered at the school.

We develop our links with the local community so students can gain vocational skills needed with business and hospitality and in the area of farming and forestry. Ruapehu College is unique in its diversity.

Our school has strong cultural and pastoral values. We value the affinity with our local Iwi and celebrate our connections to whanau and community in Ohakune, Raetihi, Waiouru, National Park and the greater Ruapehu District.
Your child will grow and develop in this environment so they can become great citizens of the future.

Whaia e koe te iti kahurangi; ki te tuohu koe, me he maunga teitei.

Seek the treasure you value most deeply: if you bow your head, let it be to the lofty mountain.

Whaia e koe te iti kahurangi

Ki te tuohu koe me he maunga teitei
