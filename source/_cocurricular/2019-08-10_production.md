Ruapehu College offers students the opportunity to audition for the annual school production. This is an activity that requires dedication and commitment beyond the classroom in order to produce quality shows. The last five years have seen very high caliber performances given including locally penned plays based on events in the Ohakune area. 

"Mountain Uplift" (2016) and "Mollie" (2018) were both very well received by audiences as Ruapehu College sought to re-ignite the annual Production. Comedy-farce "There's An App For That?" (2019) had large audiences in stiches and the dark-comedy "A Tomb With A View" (2019) was a nail-biting, sold-out show performed in an up-close and intimate theatre style.

Covid-19 spoiled any chance for the theatrical endeavour in 2020, therefore the students are very excited to have begun rehearsals for the New Zealand play: "Wheeler's Luck". More information on performance dates will be published soon.

A number of our students have been assessed at NCEA Level 1, 2 and 3 in Drama, including externally moderated 'Excellence' results at each of these levels. Ruapehu College is very proud of the reputation earned by our ƒÅkonga in the dramatic arts and recognises their commitment to achieving this.
