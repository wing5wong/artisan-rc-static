Kia ora koutoa katoa



Our school has been randomly selected to be part of the National Youth Health and Wellbeing Survey 2021 – whataboutme.nz on the 27th of October, and the Board of Trustees have agreed for our school to participate. 

This survey will engage with 14,000 students across the country and will ask the young people to share what is important about their health and wellbeing. 



Firstly, this survey is anonymous. People at school will know if a young person has been invited to take part. But no one will know what anyone says in the survey. No names will be used. Nobody, including the research team, schools, education providers, Youth-One-Stop Shops or anyone in government will know what a young person says in their answers.   

Secondly, this survey will:

 ■ support healthy development as young people grow into adulthood

 ■ keep track of government-funded policies and programmes to make sure they are working for young people

 ■ get better outcomes for young people through helping to improve policies and services  

Lastly, it is optional to participate and your child can 'opt out' anytime during the survey.  

If you do not want your child to participate, or your child doesn't want to participate, you can either:

■ complete and return the 'opt out' form attached

■ inform the school via text or phone call

■ your child can inform us or the researchers on the day



For more detailed information, please see the information attached.
