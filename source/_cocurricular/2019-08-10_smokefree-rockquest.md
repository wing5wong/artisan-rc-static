Smokefree Rockquest 2025, powered by Rockshop, is back and louder than ever! This iconic nationwide music event gives young musicians across Aotearoa the chance to take the stage, perform their own original songs, and soak up the spotlight—from Northland all the way to Southland. It's all about giving youth a platform to express themselves, connect through music, and maybe even take the first step toward a career in the industry.

This year, two of our very own student bands hit the stage at the Whanganui Regional Final on May 17th, held at the Whanganui Royal Opera House. Leon’s Raven, a six-member group, and Bonnie and the Clydes, made up of five talented performers, both bands wowed with heartfelt performances that showed just how much time and talent went into preparing for the big night. Performing in front of a live audience can be pretty daunting, especially on such a grand stage but these students handled it like pros and absolutely smashed it!

A special shout-out goes to Bonnie and the Clydes, who walked away with the Best Song award for their original track “Oh, Honey.” We’re incredibly proud of both bands for representing Ruapehu with style, soul, and serious sound. Keep an eye (and an ear) out—we’ve got some rising stars in our midst!
