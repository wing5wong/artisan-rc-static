The Smokefree Rockquest has become the lynchpin of events for secondary school musicians over the last 30 years. Ruapehu College has entered this event consistently since 2017 and enjoyed some great success sharing their songwriting and performing passions in competition against other secondary schools in the Whanganui region. So far, one act has made the eye of the National Finals panel.

Musicians may enter as a solo act, duo, or band. Each act is required to compose and perform original compositions in the regional shows in an attempt to gain the opportunity to record a live video of material to be considered for the National Final. Many a-Rockquest competitor has gone on to forge a career in the music industry including Anika Moa, Bic Runga, Nesian Mystik, Evermore, Broods, and Alien Weaponry.

Thousands of students from across Aotearoa enter every year and the Whanganui region is growing rapidly. Our students work very hard to get to Rockquest, with many rehearsals and sessions outside of school hours. This commitment is what enables our students to succeed on this stage, in this event. Commitment, focus and dedication.
