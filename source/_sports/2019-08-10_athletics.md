Athletics Day

The students  compete in their ages for the field events. There were points for participation and points for the students who were placed in their activities which included High jump, long jump, discus, shot put, triple jump and javelin.

 When the field events were finished, it was time for the track events. 

 The races were fiercely contested and there were some very fast runs. The day ended with the whanau relays and the famous ‘student verse staff’ relay.

Congratulations to all out participants, winners and the staff who organised the day. Students will be selected for the Whanganui Secondary Schools Athletics Competition..
