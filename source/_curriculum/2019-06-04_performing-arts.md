### Production

Ruapehu College offers all students the opportunity to audition for the annual school production. This is an activity that requires dedication and commitment beyond the classroom in order to produce quality shows. The last two years have seen some very high caliber performances given in locally penned plays based on events in the Ohakune area. "Mountain Uplift" (2016) and "Mollie" (2018) were both very well received by audiences.
