‘Inspiring Stories’ are stories shared by local alumni and iwi leaders on belonging, potential, pathways, and the Habits of Mind. 

It is hoped that the sharing of these stories will encourage and inspire our learners and increase student engagement. 

The stories are captured in a video library, available for our local schools to show in class and share as a learning resource.

Stories of belonging, shared by iwi leaders, focus on people and place. Stories of potential, shared by our alumni, focus on their chosen career pathways and the challenges that they have faced and overcome thus far. In recounting the challenges, the alumni highlight the role the Habits of Mind* have placed as important tools in their toolkit.

Although this resource includes prescribed lesson plans, this resource is designed to be used flexibly and we encourage educators to tailor lessons to best suit the needs of their students, classes, and learning objectives.

\*The Habits of Mind are 16 thought behaviours and dispositions that aid one’s capacity to both think on multiple levels as well as confront problems with no easy solution. For further information and additional resources on the Habits of Mind, see www.habitsofmindinstitute.org.
